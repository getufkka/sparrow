Problems
========
* use emacs server to reduce load time
* caseless multiple cursors
* auto-update git-grep results on save
* easy way to replace every symbol within a git repo

Problems?
=========
- emacs always prompts you when killing shell (but there is *always* a running process, if you're in a shell)
 - solution: C-d then kill the buffer
